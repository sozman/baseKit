/// A protocol that defines the structure of a network request used by `NetworkClient`.
///
/// `RequestProtocol` enforces type safety by associating specific `Body` and `Response` types
/// with each request, enabling compile-time validation and automatic JSON encoding/decoding.
///
/// Conforming types describe:
/// - The endpoint configuration (URL path, method, headers)
/// - The request body (if any)
/// - The expected response type
///
/// This protocol is the core abstraction for making clean and composable API calls.
