/// A generic base class for implementing route-driven coordinators in an MVVM-Coordinator architecture.
///
/// `BaseCoordinator` provides a foundation for coordinators that respond to high-level navigation actions (routes)
/// defined via a `Route` type. It handles navigation via an injected `UINavigationController` and delegates
/// actual routing logic to subclasses.
///
/// - Note: Subclasses must override `start()` to define their initial screen flow.
/// - Tip: Use the `handle(_:)` method to navigate based on `enum`-based route definitions.

    ///
    /// Typically used in coordination patterns to notify the parent coordinator
    /// that the child flow can be dismissed or deallocated.
    ///
    /// You should call `onFinish?()` when the view controller or coordinator
    /// has finished its task (e.g., after login, onboarding, or form submission).
